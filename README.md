Purpose of this quick project
  - Review coding skills
  - Learn about CSS transformations
  - Testing to see what was remembered and what was forgotton
  - HTML structure (taken from w3schools.com) was to understand how the structure worked for this card flipping to work because I was initially stuck on figuring out how to make the card flip.

* HTML structure is the same from w3schools.com  (The code in the HTML is theirs, not mine.)
